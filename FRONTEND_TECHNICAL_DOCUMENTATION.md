# Speech-to-Text AI Application Technical Documentation

## Project Overview

This project is a Speech-to-Text AI application that allows users to interact with an AI assistant using both text and voice input. The application is built using React and integrates speech recognition and synthesis capabilities.

## Main Component: ChatComponent

The core functionality of the application is implemented in the `ChatComponent.jsx` file. This component handles the user interface, speech recognition, and communication with the AI backend.

### Key Features

1. **Text and Voice Input**: Users can type messages or use voice input to communicate with the AI.
2. **Speech Recognition**: The application uses the Web Speech API for real-time speech recognition.
3. **Speech Synthesis**: AI responses are read aloud using the Web Speech API's speech synthesis capabilities.
4. **Conversation History**: The application maintains a conversation history, displaying both user and AI messages.
5. **Real-time Updates**: The chat interface updates in real-time as messages are sent and received.
6. **Loading Indicators**: Visual feedback is provided during message processing.

### Component Structure

The `ChatComponent` is a functional React component that uses various hooks for state management and side effects:

- `useState`: Manages component state (user input, conversation history, listening status, etc.)
- `useEffect`: Handles side effects like initializing speech recognition and scrolling the chat container
- `useRef`: Maintains references to the speech recognition object and chat container DOM element

### Key Functions

1. `handleSubmit`: Processes user input and sends it to the AI backend
2. `sendMessage`: Sends user messages to the backend and processes AI responses
3. `toggleListening`: Toggles speech recognition on and off
4. `speakMessage`: Uses speech synthesis to read out AI responses

### API Communication

The application communicates with an AI backend server:

- Endpoint: `http://3.106.129.114:8000/chat`
- Method: POST
- Request Payload: 
  - `user_input`: The user's message
  - `conversation_history`: The current conversation history

### User Interface

The UI is built using a combination of custom CSS and utility classes (likely Tailwind CSS based on the class names). It features:

- A scrollable chat container displaying the conversation history
- An input field for text messages
- A submit button for sending messages
- A toggle button for activating/deactivating voice input
- Loading indicators for visual feedback during AI processing

## Additional Components and Files

- `aiAgent.js`: Likely contains logic for the AI agent's behavior or configuration.
- `AudioRecorder.jsx`: May handle audio recording functionality, possibly for voice message features.
- `App.jsx`: The main application component that likely renders the ChatComponent and manages overall app structure.
- `errorLogger.js`: Implements error logging functionality, which could be used for debugging and monitoring.
- `main.jsx`: The entry point of the React application, responsible for rendering the App component and any necessary setup.
- `App.css` and `styles.css`: Contain global styles and component-specific styles for the application.
- `index.css`: May include reset styles or global CSS variables.
- `vite.config.js`: Configuration file for Vite, specifying build and development settings.
- `eslint.config.js`: ESLint configuration for maintaining code quality and consistency.
- `package.json` and `package-lock.json`: Define the project dependencies and lock file for consistent installations.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git version control.

## Deployment

The project includes instructions for deployment using PM2 and Vite:

- `PM2_DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`: Contains instructions for deploying the application using PM2, which is a process manager for Node.js applications. This likely covers how to start, stop, and monitor the application in a production environment.
- `VITE_DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`: Provides guidance on deploying the application using Vite. This may include steps for building the application for production and serving it using a static file server.

## Development Setup

The project uses Vite as its build tool and development server. To set up the development environment:

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

Vite provides fast hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized builds, which enhances the development experience and build performance.

## Conclusion

This Speech-to-Text AI application demonstrates the integration of modern web technologies to create an interactive AI assistant. It leverages React for the frontend, incorporates Web Speech API for voice interactions, and communicates with a backend AI service to provide responses to user queries. The project structure and use of tools like Vite and ESLint indicate a focus on developer experience and code quality. The inclusion of deployment instructions for both PM2 and Vite suggests flexibility in deployment options, catering to different hosting environments and scalability needs.
